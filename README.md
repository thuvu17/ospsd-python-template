# Python Project Template

## Description

This repository serves as a Python project template, providing a foundation for designing and developing fully equipped projects. It includes configurations for continuous integration, static analysis, code style adherence, and dependency management with PDM.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- PDM for Python dependency management

## Project Setup

To set up the project environment:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

3. Install PDM if you haven't already:
   ```
   pip install pdm
   ```

4. Initialize the project using PDM (if not already done):
   ```
   pdm init
   ```

5. Install project dependencies:
   ```
   pdm install
   ```

## Running the Application
